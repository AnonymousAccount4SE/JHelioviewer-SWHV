*  EVEPlugin INSTALL  *
**************************

EVEPlugin is written in Java. In order to build the whole project you need Apache Ant. 
However Eclipse can be used during the development phase.
EVEPlugin uses the version control system Bazaar in order to keep track of 
revisions, releases, milestones, bugs and blueprints. 

The source code is hosted on Launchpad: lp:~jhelioviewer-dev/jhelioviewer/EVEPlugin

This document serves only as a quick reference for building the source code. More detailed 
instructions as well as development guidelines and information can be found on
http://www.helioviewer.org/wiki/index.php?title=JHelioviewer_Development_Information


Build instructions
-------------------
I) 
Get and save the source:
		1.) Install Bazaar (http://bazaar.canonical.com/en/)
		2.) Get the latest jhelioviewer trunk 
			(http://www.helioviewer.org/wiki/index.php?title=JHelioviewer_Development_Information)
		3.) Open a terminal and type: 
			bzr branch lp:~jhelioviewer-dev/jhelioviewer/EVEPlugin ${PATH_TO_JHV_SRC}/plugins/

II) Build the source code with Ant (http://ant.apache.org/)
	1.) 	Open a terminal and change to the EVEPlugin directory in the plugins dir
	2.) 	Type the following to build EVEPlugin (files are placed in the 'build' subdirectory):
				ant
	- 	In order to build the java documentation type:
				ant doc
	- 	In order to delete temporary build files type:
				ant clean
	3.) Type 'ant install-plugin' in order to copy the jar to JHelioviewers plugin folder

Note 1: You can also build ALL plugins from the JHelioviewers root directory. The commands are:
ant release-plugins
ant doc-plugins
ant clean-plugins
ant install-plugins

Note 2: If the EVEPlugin directory is not in the plugins directory of the jhv trunk
you have to specify the location of the jhv source with:
ant -Djhv.root=PATH_TO_JHV_SRC

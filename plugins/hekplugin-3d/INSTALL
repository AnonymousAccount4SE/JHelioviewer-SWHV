*  JHelioviewer HEK Plugin INSTALL  *
*************************************

IMPORTANT
---------
Note that a non-developer version is automatically installed since JHelioviewer 2.1.
These instructions are only needed if you want do develop on the HEK Plugin.

General Information
-------------------

General development information: See JHelioviewer Project + JHelioviewer Website.

The source code of this plugin is hosted on Launchpad: https://launchpad.net/jhelioviewer

This document serves only as a quick reference for building the source code. More detailed 
instructions as well as development guidelines and information can be found on
http://www.helioviewer.org/wiki/index.php?title=JHelioviewer_Development_Information
and in JHelioviewer's INSTALL file.

Build instructions
------------------

More general information about the build process can be found in JHelioviewer's INSTALL file - 
this only represents one quick way to get the plugin running.

IT IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED TO PLACE THE HEK DIRECTORY INTO:
    ${PATH_TO_JHELIOVIEWER_SRC}/plugins/hekplugin

IF YOU PLACE THE SOURCE CODE IN AN OTHER DIRECTORY, YOU HAVE TO APPEND THE FOLLOWING
STRING TO ALL 'ant' COMMANDS SHOWN FURTHER BELOW

    '-Djhv.root="${PATH_TO_JHELIOVIEWER_SRC}"' 

Thus, changing to ${PATH_TO_JHELIOVIEWER_SRC}/plugins/ and running one of the following commands
will do the job:

- To get a fresh copy of the latest development version, run
    bzr branch lp:~jhelioviewer-dev/jhelioviewer/hekplugin

- To update an existing version of the plugin, run
    bzr pull lp:~jhelioviewer-dev/jhelioviewer/hekplugin

After this, you need to build the source code. Change to ${PATH_TO_JHELIOVIEWER_SRC}/plugins/hekplugin
and run:

    ant                   - build HEKPlugin.jar
    ant install-plugin    - build and copy/install HEKPlugin.jar into ~/JHelioviewer/Plugins/
    ant clean             - clean-up workspace

Eclipse
-------

It is recommended to import the HEK Sourcecode into the same workspace as the rest of the JHelioviewer
sourcecode.
